# Unity-2k17-Auto-Save
An auto save script that will save everytime you press play. - updated to 2017.

Just place this in a folder called "Editor" and that's it.

Everytime you press play your current scene will be saved.

Full credit goes to [daikonforge](http://www.daikonforge.com/dfgui/save-on-run/) who created this, I just updated it to 2k17.
